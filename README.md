### ⭐ About The Project: 
Locitraft is a local art promoter website, that encourages local crafters and unite them under one roof virtually.
Having a love of art is something most people can relate to. There are definitely certain types of art that appeal more to one person than another but the general idea isn’t a foreign concept. Many people enjoy the works 
                visual artists create and appreciate the work it takes to make a truly magnificent piece of artwork. 
                The harder part of being an art lover is finding ways to support artists in your local community. Depending on your level of 
                interest in owning artwork for your own private collection you may not be aware of the ways you can support your local art community. Sometimes it can feel like buying a painting is the only 
                way and that’s not always something everyone feels is accessible to them. Hence I've made this Fully Responsive website.
